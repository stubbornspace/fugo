# The Fish Dish

The secret sauce (pun intended) is to cook the fish separately and then combine everything at the end for a rich but light sauce. I’d call it a stew but by definition that is a dish where everything is cooked in one pot!

## Ingredients
1 lb fresh halibut
1 bunch of kale or chard
1 medium white onion
4 cloves of garlic
1 tbs fresh oregano
1 tbs fresh sage
1 large tin of whole plum tomatoes
1 bottle of dry white wine.
1 sourdough loaf
Plenty of olive oil

## Destructions
You’ll need 2 fry pans, use the larger of the 2 for tomato base,  the other fife the fish. Finely slice the onion and 2 cloves of garlic and soften in a large fry pan with 2 tbs of olive oil over a medium heat, 4-5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

Drain the tomatoes and squeeze them over the pansGo slow or you’ll end up with tomato sauce literally everywhere.  And, don’t by crushed, you need to squeeze them.
