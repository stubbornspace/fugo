# Carbonara

## Ingredients
* 1 lb pasta, you choose. The classic is spaghetti. I like rigatoni
* 1/2 cup diced pancetta. The thicker the slice, the better.
* 1/2 cup of frozen peas
* 4 egg yolks
* 2 eggs
* 1/2 cup of grated parmersan
* 1/4 tsp red chili flakes
* Salt, pepper and olive oil.

## Destructions

**Cook the pasta. If you need instructions stop reading and order take out. You are the weakest link!**

While the pasta is cooking, blend the egg yolks, eggs, parmesan and 2 tbs of olive oil to create a smooth sauce. Cook the peas (see how to cook pasta).

**When the pasta is almost cooked, heat 2 tbs of olive oil in a large frying pan. Add the pancetta, red chili flakes and simmer for 2-3 minutes. Drain the pasta. Reserve a cup of water if you need to thin the sauce. Combine the pasta, peas and pancetta in the frying pan.**

Remove the pan from the heat (turn off the heat and move the pan to a cooler part of the stove). Incorporate the sauce quickly, turning the pasta to avoid pasta a la scrambled eggs.

**Dress with salt and pepper, grated parmersan and a splash of olive oil. Serve immediately.**
