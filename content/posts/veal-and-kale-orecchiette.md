# Veal and kale Orecchiette

## Ingredients

* 1lb Ground veal (or pork)
* 1/2 lb Orecchiette pasta, or what ever is your preference
* Bunch of Kale, about 1 cup
* 2 Cloves garlic
* 1/2 tsp dried red chili
* 6 fresh sage leaves or 1 Tbs dried
* 1 cup of Dry white wine
* 1Tbs Tomato puree
* 1/ cup of Parmesan

## Destructions

**Heat 2tbs of olive oil over medium-high heat, add the onions and sauté until translucent, about 3-4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for a further 2-3 minutes.**

Add the sausage, stiring to break it up, once cooked through, about 4 minutes, add the paprika and the chili flakes and cook for a futher minute.

**Deglaze the pan with the white wine. Scrape the bottom of the pan as it bubbles to release the bits of flavor. Add 1 cup of the stock. Once it comes to a boil, add the orecchiette and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover the pan. Stir often making sure the orecchiette doesn’t stick to the bottom. Once the sauce begins to reduce and thicken, add stock one cup at a time, stirring and covering in between stirs.**

Continue doing this with the remaining stock until the pasta is cooked through. It will take anywhere between 16-18 minutes. This is like cooking risotto; adding liquid as needed until cooked through.

**Once the orecchiette is al-dente, toss in the parmesan and some black pepper. Check for seasoning and adjust with the salt. Plate and garnish with chives and parmesan. Enjoy!**
